# Python_Practice_Work
 Keeping a track of all small python practice codes

 ## Index:
 ### OOPs Concepts Folder:
 - Class.py - Template of intiating a class.
 - Polymorphism.py - The Eagle and Ostrich class change the function flight which is derived from the Bird Class.
 - Inheritance.py - Here Person(the base class) is inherited by Employee(the derived class) which goes ahead and uses the variables and functions of Person class.
 - Encapsulation.py - Encapsulation is we try to wrap up classes, methods and variables into one unit so that the user doesn't accidentaly change a variable value or code. In Python, Private and Protected members are present but are just customary rather than hard coded. In Python, we can call and edit protected and private variables outside the class but it is an understanding between programs to not do it.
 - Abstraction.py is empty

 ### Sorting Algorithms
  - Bubble Sort.py - Compare 2 elements and switch them if the right one is not greater than the left one.
  - Insertion Sort.py - It is where we insert an element to it's correct position while comparing 2 adjacent elements and pushing the larger one ahead.

 ### Main Folder:
 - Decorators.py - @decorators are used to wrap one function in another function
 - Printing_objects using repr and str.py - Printing Objects using __str__ and __repr__.
